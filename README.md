# React.js without JSX

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

## [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

```bash
npm i react react-dom --save
```

After dependencies installed, you can directly write React code in [index.js](./src/index.js).

JSX is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement()`, so it need to be parsed and transformed.

Since we havn't done these, we can only support React.js without JSX.
