# React-TS-Webpack

We always use `create-react-app` to start development quickly.

This lib then use `react-scripts` to execute cmd.

But how does it work behind all of these?

How can we build a React + TS + Webpack project architecture without any cli?

## Quick start

This project holds multiple branches, each of them represent one stage while building the architecture step by step:

- webpack: Show HTML page in browser
- react: React.js support
- ts: TypeScript support
- Maybe more......

Switch branch and follow `README.md` to try.
