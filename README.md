# React-TS-Webpack

We always use `create-react-app` to start development quickly.

This lib then use `react-scripts` to execute cmd.

But how does it work behind all of these?

How can we build a React + TS + Webpack project architecture without any cli?

## Quick start

This project holds multiple branches, each of them represent one stage while building the architecture step by step:

- webpack: Show HTML page in browser
- react: Support React.js without JSX
- react-jsx: Support React.js with JSX
- ts: Support TypeScript
- css: Support import CSS

Switch branch and read their `README.md` to get more details.
